Comparing scripts generated by OpenAI o3 and deepseek R1

R1 first output included two syntax errors.  It left off two closing ")" in two function declarations.   Then it had a data type issue. 
It treated the v1,v2 values as a list rather than tensor and was unable to execute .to(device).   The first re-prompt fixed this.

o3 version worked fine out of the box with zero modifications.

# training
I noticed that deepseek script consumes 170 watts on GPU while o3 script consumes 104 watts.   
I should also time the two of these to gauge relative performance.
